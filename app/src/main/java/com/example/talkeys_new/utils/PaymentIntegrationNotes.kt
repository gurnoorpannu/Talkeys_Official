/**
 * PhonePe Payment Integration Notes
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This is a basic integration setup. For production use, you need to:
 * 
 * 1. BACKEND INTEGRATION:
 *    - Create a backend API endpoint to create PhonePe orders
 *    - The backend should call PhonePe's Create Order API
 *    - Return the token and orderId to your app
 *    - Never hardcode merchant credentials in the app
 * 
 * 2. ORDER STATUS VERIFICATION:
 *    - After payment completion, always call Order Status API
 *    - The payment result from the app doesn't guarantee success
 *    - Only the Order Status API gives the final payment status
 * 
 * 3. SECURITY:
 *    - Replace "MID" and "FLOW_ID" in TalkeysApplication.kt with real values
 *    - Use RELEASE environment for production
 *    - Set enableLogging = false in production
 * 
 * 4. ERROR HANDLING:
 *    - Implement proper error handling for network failures
 *    - Handle payment timeouts and cancellations
 *    - Show appropriate user messages
 * 
 * 5. TESTING:
 *    - Use SANDBOX environment for testing
 *    - Test with different payment methods (UPI, Cards, Wallets)
 *    - Test failure scenarios
 * 
 * 6. USER EXPERIENCE:
 *    - Show loading states during payment
 *    - Provide clear success/failure messages
 *    - Allow users to retry failed payments
 * 
 * Current Implementation Status:
 * ✅ SDK Integration
 * ✅ Basic Payment Flow
 * ✅ UI Components
 * ❌ Backend Integration (needs implementation)
 * ❌ Order Status Verification (needs implementation)
 * ❌ Production Configuration (needs real credentials)
