 * PhonePe Integration Testing Guide
 * 
 * Since there's no backend implementation yet, here's what you can test:
 * 
 * ‚úÖ WHAT WORKS (Frontend Only):
 * 
 * 1. FREE EVENT FLOW:
 *    - Find an event with price = 0 or null
 *    - Click "Register Now" 
 *    - Should show "Free Event Registration" 
 *    - Click "Register for Free"
 *    - Should navigate to success screen
 * 
 * 2. UI NAVIGATION:
 *    - Event Detail ‚Üí Payment Screen ‚úÖ
 *    - Payment Screen ‚Üí Success Screen ‚úÖ
 *    - Back navigation ‚úÖ
 * 
 * 3. PAYMENT SCREEN UI:
 *    - Event details display correctly ‚úÖ
 *    - PhonePe payment option shows ‚úÖ
 *    - Loading states work ‚úÖ
 * 
 * ‚ùå WHAT WON'T WORK (Missing Backend):
 * 
 * 1. PAID EVENT FLOW:
 *    - PhonePe payment will fail with dummy token
 *    - No real money transaction
 *    - No order creation/verification
 * 
 * üß™ TESTING STEPS:
 * 
 * Step 1: Test Free Events
 * - Look for events with price 0
 * - Complete registration flow
 * - Verify success screen appears
 * 
 * Step 2: Test Paid Event UI
 * - Look for events with price > 0  
 * - Navigate to payment screen
 * - Verify PhonePe UI appears
 * - Click payment button (will fail, but UI should work)
 * 
 * Step 3: Test Navigation
 * - Test back buttons
 * - Test screen transitions
 * - Verify no crashes
 * 
 * üìù EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * 
 * Free Events: Complete flow works ‚úÖ
 * Paid Events: UI works, payment fails ‚ùå
 * Navigation: All transitions work ‚úÖ
 * Error Handling: Shows appropriate messages ‚úÖ
